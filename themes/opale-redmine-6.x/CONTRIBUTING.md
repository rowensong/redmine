# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Opale.

You can contribute in the following ways:

- Finding and reporting bugs
- Contributing code to Opale by fixing bugs or implementing features

## Bug reports

Bug reports and feature suggestions must use descriptive and concise titles and be submitted to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gagnieray/opale/issues). Please use the search function to make sure that you are not submitting duplicates, and that a similar report or request has not already been resolved or rejected.

## Pull requests

**Please use clean, concise titles for your pull requests.** Unless the pull request is about refactoring code, updating dependencies or other internal tasks, assume that the person reading the pull request title is not a programmer, but instead a Redmine user or administrator, and **try to describe your change or fix from their perspective**. For easier sorting, start your pull request titles using one of the verbs "Add", "Change", "Deprecate", "Remove", or "Fix" (present tense).

It is not always possible to phrase every change in such a manner, but it is desired.

**The smaller the set of changes in the pull request is, the quicker it can be reviewed and merged.** Splitting tasks into multiple smaller pull requests is often preferable.

**Pull requests that do not pass automated checks may not be reviewed**.
